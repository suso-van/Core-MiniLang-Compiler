# MiniLang Compiler

MiniLang Compiler is a custom-built compiler and stack-based virtual machine for a simple programming language. The project implements the full compiler pipeline from scratch, including lexical analysis, parsing, AST generation, bytecode compilation, and deterministic runtime execution. It demonstrates core concepts of compiler design, language runtimes, and execution systems.
